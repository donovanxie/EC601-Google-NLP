Google Nature Language API is a powerful tool to do sentiment analysis of human daily language, in this project, I did some tests to this API, I feed it with some greetings and trash talkings, in both English and Chinese, Nature Language API supports multi-languages, that surprised me.

as you can see from the figure above, it assigned a value to the sentiment, it is kinda like a score, when it is more positive, the score will be higher, but if you are dong some trash-talking, the sentiment score will go down to the negative side.

even the input is not English, it can still do the sentiment analysis, and the result is pretty accurate.

it can even handle some long paragraphs and give a reasonable score.
